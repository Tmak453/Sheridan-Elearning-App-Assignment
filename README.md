This is a sheridan course app in which students can login to access their courses. Features include course info, Assignment uploading, message other classmates, group chat, calendar, account page, discussion board and more.

<h2>The top five Desirable functionalities that I have not seen in other apps include:</h2>
- Video Call with other people in the class<br>
- Watch live lectures online through the app<br>
- Access content without having to be connected to wifi<br>
- Allow the user to customize the app more freely such as layout<br>
- Educational games where the main purpose is to learn from them
